"""Saving uploads, queueing them, serving them and deleting them.

Storage locations
-----------------
Local mode (no AWS keys yet): the file lands in
`public/upload/<event_id>/<uuid>.<ext>` and `images.s3_key` holds that
relative path, so the file is served from `/media/<s3_key>`.

S3 mode (keys present): the worker uploads the file, rewrites
`images.s3_key` to the object key `events/<event_id>/<uuid>.<ext>` and
clients only ever receive a presigned URL generated on the fly.
